# ALO Scraper

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`alo_scraper.ipynb`) is designed to scrape data from ALO and extract relevant information for analysis. It automates the data collection process, allowing for structured extraction, transformation, and potential storage in a database or CSV file.

## Features
- Scrapes product or content-related data from ALO
- Extracts relevant details (e.g., titles, descriptions, prices, or other metadata)
- Cleans and structures the extracted data for easy analysis
- Saves output to a structured format (CSV, JSON, or database)

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pandas
- Selenium (if applicable)

You can install these using:
```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas selenium
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook alo_scraper.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the scraper.
3. Modify configurations as needed (e.g., target URLs, output format, storage options).

## Output
- The extracted data is saved in CSV or JSON format in the designated output directory.

## Customization
- Update the URL list to scrape different pages.
- Modify the parsing logic to extract additional fields.
- Integrate with databases for automated storage.

## Notes
